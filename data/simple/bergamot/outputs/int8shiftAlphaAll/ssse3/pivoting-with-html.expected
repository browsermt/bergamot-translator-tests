    <p>The Bergamot project will add and improve client-side machine translation in a web browser.</p>
    <p>Unlike current cloud-based options, running directly on usersâ€™ machines empowers citizens to preserve their privacy and increases the uptake of language technologies in Europe in various sectors that require confidentiality. Free software integrated with an open-source web browser, such as Mozilla Firefox, will enable bottom-up adoption by non-experts, resulting in cost savings for private and public sector users who would otherwise procure translation or operate monolingually.</p>
    <p>Bergamot is a consortium coordinated by the University of Edinburgh with partners Charles University in Prague, the University of Sheffield, University of Tartu, and Mozilla.</p>
